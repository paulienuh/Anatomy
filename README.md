# Human Anatomy
Anatomy is cool â˜  

...and my favourite part of my Biomedical Sciences degree. I mean who doesn't love learning more about their insides, amirite?

This repo includes my <em>BMS246 Introduction to Human Anatomy</em> <b>#GivaLiva Campaign</b> and upcoming Anatomy projects in my final year for <em>BMS352 in Forensic Anatomy.</em>
